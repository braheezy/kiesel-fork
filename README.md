## Introduction

_Kiesel_ (/ˈkiːzəl/) is a JavaScript engine written from scratch for the purpose
of [me](https://linus.dev) learning the
[Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org), with the eventual goal of full
support for the latest [ECMAScript](https://tc39.es/ecma262/) standard. It
features a custom bytecode VM and runtime, and aims to implement as much as
possible in pure Zig - currently with the following exceptions:

- [bdwgc](https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc) for garbage collected allocations
- [libregexp](https://github.com/bellard/quickjs/blob/master/libregexp.h) for
  regular expressions
- [ICU4X](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x) for `Intl`-related functionality

A simple CLI (REPL/file interpreter) is available but being easy to embed in
other projects is also a goal.

The implementation style is similar to [LibJS](https://libjs.dev) - the JS
engine used in SerenityOS and the Ladybird browser which I worked on before - in
various aspects, most notably the desire to stay very close to spec. Development
is still at an early stage and the engine's usefulness thus limited. While there
are various things that already work well, there's an equal amount of things
that don't :^)

Please refrain from filing issues for missing features - many are missing!
Similarly, please get in touch before starting to work on something larger than
a bug fix.

## Build

Dependencies managed through [`build.zig.zon`](./build.zig.zon) will be
installed automatically when building for the first time.

To build and run the Kiesel CLI:

```console
zig build run
```

NOTE: Kiesel targets the master branch of Zig. This means that the build breaks
semi-regularly, which I will usually fix as soon as I notice.

### Build Options

These can be set by passing `-D<name>=<value>` to `zig build`.

| Name             | Default | Description                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enable-annex-b` | `true`  | Enables support for [ECMA-262 Annex B](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-additional-ecmascript-features-for-web-browsers) language features. |
| `enable-intl`    | `true`  | Enables support for [ECMA-402 (`Intl`)](https://tc39.es/ecma402/), which depends on `cargo` being available for the ICU4X library.      |
| `enable-legacy`  | `true`  | Enables support for [legacy](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-conformance) language features                                                |
